Elysion Game Framework
======================

What is this?
-------------

Elysion is a cross-plaform (currently supporting Windows, Linux and Mac OS X)
framework for creating games with ease and is therefore suited for rapid prototyping.

Who made this?
-------------

Elysion has been more or less regurarly in development since 2005 and has been
created by Johannes Stein.

Thanks to anyone who used (or whom I forced to use ;) ) this framework. This  
framework would not exist in its current form without those people:  
- Sven Rech (Initial Linux testing)  
- David Herzog (Early sprite lists and in general a very helpful guy)  
- Jesse Klugmann  
- Christian Fuchs  
- Arthur Baude  
- Dominique Louis (He made SDL bindings for Object Pascal)  
- Sam Lantinga (The creator of SDL)  
And of course thanks to everyone else who used this framework or gave it a shot.


Also thanks to these pieces of software which inspired me:  
- [Irrlicht 3D Engine](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net)  
- [Horde 3D](http://horde3d.org) / Horde 3D GameEngine  
- [Gosu](http://libgosu.org)  
- [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com)  
- [Flashpunk](http://flashpunk.net/)
- [Sparrow Framework](http://www.sparrow-framework.org/)

What does it look like?
-----------------------

Elysion is designed to be high-level with its API to be very simple and intuitive.  
Here is a chunk of code which loads a sprite, displays the sprite and randomly  
changes its color with each click.  


	var mySprite: TelSprite;

	mySprite := TelSprite.Create;
	mySprite.LoadFromFile('mySprite.png');

	mySprite.Draw;

	if (mySprite.Click) then
	begin
	  Randomize;
	  mySprite.Color.R := Random(255);
	  mySprite.Color.G := Random(255);
	  mySprite.Color.B := Random(255);
	  // Alternative you could also write: mySprite.Color := makeCol(Random(255), Random(255), Random(255));
	end;

	
That of course is just a small example of what Elysion can do. It is a full-fledged game framework and aims to be so: It allows you to play sound and music via ElysionAudio (which is based upon SDL_mixer), a texture manager which takes care of all your textures without you needing to worry about it, Elysion has a storage system similar to HTML5 Localstorage, integrated support for Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), as well as game-specific class and helpers (such as adding nodes to scenes).
