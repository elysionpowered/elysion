V11-06a:
+ Added: ElysionTypes.Border, ElysionTypes.BorderRadius, ElysionTypes.ExtValues (Data types for CSS-like styling)
* Replaced: TelNode.Offset is now TelNode.Origin (for rotation offset) and TelNode.Margin (for position offset)
+ Added: TelNode.Border and TelNode.Padding
+ Added: ElysionTypes.TelGaugeFloat (= ElysionTypes.TelGauge) and ElysionTypes.TelGaugeInt (Non-visual gauge data type that can be used for health bars, progress, etc.)
+ Added: Custom bounding box rectangle support for TelSprite (TelSprite.CustomBBox)
+ Added: Better handling bounding boxes in TelSprite using TelSprite.BoundingBox (also includes better support for per-pixel collision in TelSprite.MouseOver and TelSprite.Click)

+ Added: function ElysionTypes.IsInRange (checks if a value in between a min and max value), was previously a part of the default template in uBasic.pas

* Fixed: DrawLine functions now have TelVector2f as a parameter instead of TelVector2i

+ Added: Integrated ElysionScene.TelSceneDirector into ElysionScene.TelGame
